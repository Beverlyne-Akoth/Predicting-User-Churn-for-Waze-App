    "The XGBoost model made more use of many of the features than did the logistic regression model from the previous course, which weighted a single feature (`activity_days`) very heavily in its final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "If anything, this underscores the importance of feature engineering. Notice that engineered features accounted for six of the top 10 features (and three of the top five). Feature engineering is often one of the best and easiest ways to boost model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that the important features in one model might not be the same as the important features in another model. That's why you shouldn't discount features as unimportant without thoroughly examining them and understanding their relationship with the dependent variable, if possible. These discrepancies between features selected by models are typically caused by complex feature interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? What insights can you report back to stakeholders?"

    "> _It depends. What would the model be used for? If it's used to drive consequential business decisions, then no. The model is not a strong enough predictor, as made clear by its poor recall score. However, if the model is only being used to guide further exploratory efforts, then it can have value._\n",

    "2. What tradeoff was made by splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets as opposed to just training and test sets?\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Splitting the data three ways means that there is less data available to train the model than splitting just two ways. However, performing model selection on a separate validation set enables testing of the champion model by itself on the test set, which gives a better estimate of future performance than splitting the data two ways and selecting a champion model by performance on the test data._\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the benefit of using a logistic regression model over an ensemble of tree-based models (like random forest or XGBoost) for classification tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Logistic regression models are easier to interpret. Because they assign coefficients to predictor variables, they reveal not only which features factored most heavily into their final predictions, but also the directionality of the weight. In other words, they tell you if each feature is positively or negatively correlated with the target in the model's final prediction._\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the benefit of using an ensemble of tree-based models like random forest or XGBoost over a logistic regression model for classification tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Tree-based model ensembles are often better predictors. If the most important thing is the predictive power of the model, then tree-based modeling will usually win out against logistic regression (but not always!). They also require much less data cleaning and require fewer assumptions about the underlying distributions of their predictor variables, so they're easier to work with._\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What could you do to improve this model?\n",
    "\n",
    "> _New features could be engineered to try to generate better predictive signal, as they often do if you have domain knowledge. In the case of this model, the engineered features made up over half of the top 10 most-predictive features used by the model. It could also be helpful to reconstruct the model with different combinations of predictor variables to reduce noise from unpredictive features._\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What additional features would you like to have to help improve the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "> _It would be helpful to have drive-level information for each user (such as drive times, geographic locations, etc.). It would probably also be helpful to have more granular data to know how users interact with the app. For example, how often do they report or confirm road hazard alerts? Finally, it could be helpful to know the monthly count of unique starting and ending locations each driver inputs._\n"
